Hi! My name is Chris Ward.

If you are reading this, it likely means I've seen your CV 
and believe you could be a great match for type of work our 
team at Red Hat is looking for some help with.

The following is a simple homework assignment I've cooked up 
for you to demonstrate your JS skillz and general 
ambitions to impress me and other folks here at Red Hat.

If you're interested, please fork this repo and solve the
following problem as best as you can within 72 hours of
forking the repo.

Send a 'github pull request' when your solution is ready for 
review. 

Assignment:: 

    Create a new reposity on github with a single page 
    web application using Node, Vue2 + Vuetify and deploy 
    it on-line to Firebase using their FREE hosting tier.

    https://vuejs.org/
    https://vuetifyjs.com
    http://firebase.google.com/

    * The Vue2 + Vuetify application should be built using 
      `vue-cli` and the `vuetifyjs/webpack-advanced` project 
      template

    * The Vue2 application must have one single page.
    
    * That single page should have just one button (v-btn).
    
    * That button, when clicked (toggle ON), should toggle a 
      Vuetify success alert (v-alert) with the text 'Whoops! 
      An error occured!' When clicked again, (toggle OFF), the 
      alert should disappear.
    
    * For bonus points, the global state of that button, whether it was
      most recently toggled ON or toggle OFF should be remembered
      without authentication. (hint, update firebase database rules).
            
I should be able to clone your github repository and run your 
Vue2 webapp locally with `npm run dev` and it should be deployed
live to firebase. Share a link to the live instance in your 
response.

If you have any questions, file an issue in GitHub. :)

Looking forward to hearing from you! Good luck!
